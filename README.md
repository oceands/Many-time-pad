# Many-time-pad
In cryptography, the one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique renowned for its unbreakable security, provided it uses a one-time pre-shared key that is at least as long as the message being transmitted. This method adheres to the requirements of perfect secrecy. Let's explore the vulnerabilities that arise when a "one-time" pad is reused.
