# One-Time Pad Cryptography

## Overview

This project explores the concepts of one-time pad (OTP) cryptography and the consequences of reusing the pad, also known as the "many-time" pad problem.

## One-Time Pad

The one-time pad (OTP) is an encryption technique that guarantees unbreakable security by using a unique key that is as long as the message. This method ensures perfect secrecy, meaning that the ciphertext provides no additional information about the plaintext.

### Perfect Secrecy

Perfect secrecy is achieved when:

\[ P(M=m \mid C=c) = P(M=m) \]

In simpler terms, knowing the ciphertext does not reveal any information about the original message. The probability of any specific message \( M \) remains constant, regardless of the ciphertext \( C \).

## Many-Time Pad

Reusing a one-time pad compromises its security, leading to potential vulnerabilities. This project includes a file, `ciphertexts.txt`, which contains hex-encoded ciphertexts generated by encrypting different ASCII messages using the same pad.

### Key Concept

- Plaintext messages are composed exclusively of letters and spaces.
- The main idea to crack these codes is to analyze the XOR operation between a space character and an uppercase or lowercase letter.

## Files

- `ciphertexts.txt`: A text file containing hex-encoded ciphertexts for analysis.

## How to Use

1. **Examine the Ciphertexts**: Open the `ciphertexts.txt` file to view the encrypted messages.
2. **Understand XOR Operation**: Learn how XORing a space with a letter affects the ciphertext.
3. **Decrypt the Messages**: Use the insights gained to attempt decryption of the messages.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the importance of using a one-time pad correctly and the risks associated with reusing the pad. By examining the provided ciphertexts, you can gain a deeper understanding of cryptographic principles and the significance of perfect secrecy.
